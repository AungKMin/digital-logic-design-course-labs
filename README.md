# Digital Logic Course Labs/Projects.

### Lab 1 (~3hours)
Logic operators with polarity control switch. 

### Lab 2 (~5hours)
 Simple ALU. An input signal chooses between two functionalities: 
* AND, OR, XOR, NXOR gates
* four-bit adder 

### Lab 3 (~10 hours)
Home energy monitor that uses measured thermometer temperature and other signals (door open, window open, etc) to control the heater and cooler signals. The temperatures were displayed on seven-segment display.

The lab was an exercise in circuit design using fundamental logic operators (AND, OR, XOR, NXOR).

### Lab 4 (~25 hours)
Robotic Arm Controller. Take position and button inputs to control a robotic arm.  

The lab was mostly an exercise in state machine design. The major challenges were related to taking into account the timing of the button press-release inputs.
